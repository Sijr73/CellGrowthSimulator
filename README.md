# Cell Growth Simulator

## Overview

**Cell Growth Simulator**  is an intuitive web application for Growth Balance Analysis (GBA) of self-replicating cell models. Built with R/Shiny, it features a user-friendly, spreadsheet-style interface that enables researchers to model cellular resource allocation under nonlinear kinetic rate laws. Cell Growth Simulator streamlines model construction by integrating enzyme kinetics and parameter data from the BRENDA database, and generating dynamic visualizations of metabolic pathways. By lowering computational barriers, Cell Growth Simulator makes nonlinear cellular modeling more accessible to the broader scientific community.
